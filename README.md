## Day 1 - Monday

M6 - 01- Python Notebook: This file reviews the types of variables and basic operations.

M6 - 02 - Condicionales: In this file there are some exercises of conditionals.

## Day 2 - Tuesday

M6 - SpaceX - 1 - Data Collection Api: In this practice we will obtain the data to predict if a falcon 9 will land successfully or not. The data will be collected through the SpaceX API and we will ensure that it follows an appropriate format for the following phases.

M6 - SpaceX - 2- EDA: In this practice we will do some Exploratory Data Analysis looking for patterns in the data and thus determine what values we should use to make predictions in the future. We'll see if we can predict the probability of success based on certain categories.

## Day 3 - Wednesday

M6 -04 - Programación Funcional: a brief review of lambda functions to coding with functional style in Python. In addition, examples of using the map and filter function against conventional loops.

M5 - SPACEX2 - 6 - Machine Learning: In this notebook we try to find the best hyperparameters for SVM, KNN classifier, classification trees, and logistic regression. Finding the best performing method using the test data using all the techniques learned during module 5 (M5) of the course.

## Day 4 - Thursday

M6 - 05 - SparkSession Teoría: Introductory Notebook on what is PySpark and how to use it.

M6 - 03 - Primer RDD Teoría: Introductory Notebook on what RDDs are, how to create an RDD and how to apply first transformations and actions on it.
